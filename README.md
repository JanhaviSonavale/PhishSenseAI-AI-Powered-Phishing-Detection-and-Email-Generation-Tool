# PhishSenseAI-AI-Powered-Phishing-Detection-and-Email-Generation-Tool
<br>
AI IN GENERATING EMAIL AND PHISHING DETECTION
<br>
## 🔎 Overview

**PhishSenseAI** is an AI-driven cybersecurity tool that helps detect phishing emails and generate synthetic ones for training and testing. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Machine Learning classifier trained on real-world data to flag suspicious messages. Additionally, it can simulate phishing and legitimate emails for use in security awareness programs.

## 🎯 Project Motivation

With the rise of AI-enhanced cyber threats, traditional spam filters and heuristic-based detection methods are no longer sufficient. Phishing emails have become:

- Highly **personalized**
- Harder to **detect**
- Often **crafted using AI**

PhishSenseAI aims to **counter AI with AI** — equipping defenders with tools just as advanced as those used by attackers.
